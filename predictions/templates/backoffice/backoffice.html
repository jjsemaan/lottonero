                                The 'Scrape' button should only be clicked once at 10:30 pm (Irish Time)
                                every Tuesday and Friday, after the draw results have been published to
                                the accessible results page of the official EuroMillions website
                                <a href="https://www.lottery.ie/accessible-results" target="_blank"

                                </a>. The scrape button will parse two actions one after the other.
                                First, it will scrape the jackpot results. Second, it will check for
                                any winning predictions for both AI Patterns and AI Combinations.
                                The scrape output will be written to the database and displayed on
                                the Home page.

                                N.B. You will need to add the values / win amount of the winning
                                predictions manually from the admin panel as the developer was
                                not able to scrape these values and had deemed this to be a future
                                enhancement.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Once scraped, use the below date picker to select the next upcoming
                                draw date and click the 'Predict' button. The predict button will add
                                new predictions for both AI Patterns and AI Combinations for our
                                subscribers to choose from.

                                The upload button is used for the purpose of uploading the website
                                images to coludinary and was used by the developer to reference all
                                images within the code of Lottonero. During the development, 126
                                images were uploaded to the databaee. Once uploaded, each image name
                                and url can be queried and utilised for various uses in the website.
                                This automation exercise had leveraged development efficiency and will
                                be kept to enable the development of future enhancements.
